# Speedtest

Test the network connection speed by reading and writing a file over the network.

Intended to be run as a simple linux command line tool that takes command lin options and writes to stdout. Or you can import the ruby gem and add to your own script.

## TODO
* Update README to include setup
* Fix bin/speedtest to use absolute require
